-- WHY:
-- Combine experiment outcomes with user-level activity coverage.
--
-- auth_data contains multiple rows per user, so it is first
-- reduced to one row per user. This prevents activity events
-- from multiplying experiment users during the join.
--
-- The result helps answer:
--   Are the experiment groups similarly represented in the
--   supporting activity data while their business outcomes differ?
