-- WHY:
-- Compare monetization between Control A and Test B.
--
-- ARPU  = total revenue / all experiment users
-- ARPPU = total revenue / paying users
--
-- Looking at both metrics helps separate:
--   1. revenue generated across the full population, and
--   2. revenue intensity among users who actually pay.
