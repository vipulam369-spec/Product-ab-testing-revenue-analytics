-- WHY:
-- Establish the experiment population and allocation directly
-- in SQL.
--
-- This query answers:
--   How many users are in each experiment group, and what share
--   of the total experiment population does each group represent?
--
-- We keep this query at user level because ab_test is one row
-- per experiment user.
