-- WHY:
-- Measure the percentage of experiment users who generated
-- positive revenue in each group.
--
-- Conversion is treated as a binary user outcome:
--   payer     = revenue > 0
--   non-payer = revenue = 0
--
-- The query also shows the absolute difference and relative
-- change from Control A to Test B.
