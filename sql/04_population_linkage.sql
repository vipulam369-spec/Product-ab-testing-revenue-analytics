-- WHY:
-- Measure how much of the experiment population can be linked
-- to the supporting registration and activity tables.
--
-- IMPORTANT:
-- auth_data contains multiple rows per user.
-- We therefore use EXISTS rather than joining raw activity rows
-- to the experiment population. This preserves one row per
-- experiment user and avoids accidental row multiplication.
